# Introduction to: Capture The Flag (CTF) / Competitive Hacking

&nbsp;  

## What they are

## How they work

## How you can start pwning and catching all the flags

## Live demo of some common and (relatively) easy CTF challenges

## What even *are* CTFs?

CTFs are a fun and interactive way of 'gameifying' the way we think of security in the cyber world while learning all kinds of new things

&nbsp;  

There are multiple ways to partake in CTFs, such as:

### Wargame Style (OverTheWire, HackTheBox, and many more)

### Jeopardy Style (Hosted by organizations every now and then)

### Attack - Defense (Red Team / Blue Team)

More on these in just a second, but first..

## I like games and all.. but WHY CTFs?

CTFs offer the possibility of learning new and exciting ways to hack, break and misuse things, while also often having some sort of prize or sense of accomplishment tied to them.

&nbsp;  

Some of the things that you learn while playing CTFs are very much so applicable to real life scenarios:

+ Securing and building upon your own projects (programs, websites, etc.)
+ Bug Hunting (can bring in good $$$, depending on what kind of vulnerabilities you find)
+ Improving your general IT/Computer skills is always good and fun

---

## Okay, you've got me interested, how do I partake?

### To start playing CTFs you're going to want to make a few preparations

+ You'll need a computer, or access to one (duh)
+ A security / pentesting distro of Linux, for example **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS**. These can often be run inside a virtual machine in live mode for ease of use.
+ Some tools to aid you; many great ones are included in the above two distros.

Some of the most useful tools included in the distros mentioned above include, but is *not* limited to: Ghidra, Gobuster, Nmap, Wireshark, Burpsuite, JohnTheRipper, and many more.

Earlier I mentioned different *kinds* of CTFs: let us look **closelier..**

## Wargames

Often these services are split into multiple levels, each locked, holding the passwords to the next level somewhere inside.
The Wargame styled CTFs generally follow this model:

1. Connect to a service/server/website
2. Explore and see if you can find any things to advance to the next level
3. ???
4. Win!

Examples of sites for this:

+ [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) (There'll be a quick demo of this later!)
+ [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
+ [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/)
+ [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/)

## Jeopardy

Jeopardy styled CTFs are often in the form of competitions, hosted only for a limited amount of time and have problems pertaining to several categories:

+ Cryptography
+ Reverse Engineering & Pwn
+ Web
+ Digital Forensics
+ Misc.

Commonly played in teams, the aim is to find something resembling something like **flag{}** and submitting it for points. Some examples:

+ [kauotic{th15_15_wh4t_1_c4ll_4_fl4g_b4by!}]()
+ [funCTF{c62e84401759b876bcd2bb060bea38ffd31d5748}]()

## More on Jeopardy

So, when and where do these competitions happen?

### Upcoming CTF event websites

+ [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/event/list/) is a great place to start your search: many organizations list their upcoming CTFs here.
+ [HackTheBox](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/events/upcoming) also host upcoming CTFs, both public and private.
+ In addition to the above, google will always be your best friend.

Here in KAUotic we have lovely Kaptains that constantly are on the look for these CTFs that might be fun to join with our club team. Anyone that wants to, is free to join!

Psst.. We also have a website with all of our [*links*](https://kauotic.se/)

## Enough yapping - it's time to find out how to actually solve something

For this live demo, we'll be taking a look at OverTheWire: Bandit, some of the earlier levels are relatively easy and mostly rely on knowledge of Linux commands.

Feel free to follow along with what's happening on the screen, I'll be starting with [bandit0:](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)

## Some examples of Jeopardy style problems

To begin with, we'll look at some relatively easy CTF challenges, and some that KAUotic encountered and solved during previous CTFs:

+ What am I even anymore? (weirdfile)
+ Lemonade Stand (v1)
+ Ghost In The Machine

Next, we'll be taking a look at a range of challanges that were part of a small CTF hosted just yesterday, 7/12, by Inet/ESET. The page remains active for an unknown amount of time.

The challenges are available at the website [](https://www.hackainet.se).
